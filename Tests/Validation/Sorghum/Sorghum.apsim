	Note: If you have Observered data for some samplings but not others, then in the .out file (for the observations) you can use * or ?  for those missing values instead of using 0
	
	This allows you to tell the difference between data you did not collect, and data that actually had a value of 0
	
	Data with a * or ? is not plotted on the graph (hence neither is its predicted value) whereas data with 0 is.
	
	Note: You can add error bars to your Observed data by adding an extra column with the same name but with the word "Error" appended to the column name.
          eg. If you have a column called "yield" you would add an extra column called "yieldError" to your Observed data output file. 
              (It is very important you don't put any spaces between the "yield" and "Error")
