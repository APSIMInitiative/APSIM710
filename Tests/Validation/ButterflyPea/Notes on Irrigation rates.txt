Last years BFP was planted end of Feburary. The reason there was little growth in march was because the plants were emerging and just little seedlings. The increase in biomass in April I assume is when the seedlings had enough leaf to start booming along with plenty of leaf to fuel future growth. All the biomass info is in this work book on 'Harvest' sheet.
 << File: Raw Data.xls >>

Hi Max, Can you please send me the files you calculate biomass with. From the data I have, the first reasonable growth we had was in April. Is that what your files say as well. Planted in January but no decent growth till April.

Cheers
Jo

G'day Jo

Both the dryland and irrigation were sown onto a full profile. But after the Jan/Feb floods last year every soil was full profile. The dryland never received an irrigation and was over 25-30m away from the irrigation plot.

Irrigation was supplied by pipes and sprinklers, not flood!
The first irrigation was applied in the 3rd week of March. I set up the solarimeters on Thursday 20th March so the irrigation must have been after that. Best guess is between 21-24th March so call it Friday 21st March. The irrigation was the equivalent of 2" (50mm) rainfall.
The second irrigation was applied between Monday 12th May and Friday 16th May. I harvested the irrigation plot on the Tue 20th May and I never harvested a muddy irrigation plot. I don't think Tony would have irrigated on the weekend either. There should have been another 2" (50mm) applied. 
I don't remember any irrigations during winter or spring.

I've updated the rainfall info in:
U:\Projects\Farming Systems\CQSFS3\Theme 6 Land Use\6.2 Enterprise Integration\Data\Butterfly pea
 Climate data.xls. I'll get the info for August and Sep soon

Cheers

Max

Hi Max, I'm making a bit more progress on modelling bfp at Emerald. Next thing I need from you is what dates you applied irrigation. Would you have that recorded? Also, would you have the amounts applied?

Was the "dryland" crop completely dry, ie. No irrigation at all, even before planting. Please confirm. Else, if irrigated prior to planting, please send me dates and amounts.

Thanks
Jo

Hi Maurie and Max,
Could you please send me the date when bfp was planted at ERS last year - was it 21 Feb 2008?
