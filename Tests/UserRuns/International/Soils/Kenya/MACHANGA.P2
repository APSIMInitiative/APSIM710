! These are the inputs for the SoilP module for the experiment at Mutua's Farm
! labile_P is assumed to be similar to the bicarbonate extractable P
! unavail_P need not be specified.  If no values given, ratio labile_P:unavail_P
! is set to availP_ratio (as given in soilp.ini)
! banded_P and rock_P provide option to initialise model with non-zero values
! sorption is measure of the soil's capacity to sorb P and
!                 is used to relate P uptake to labile P in soil
