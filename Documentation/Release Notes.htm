      <h1>APSIM 7.3 release notes</h1>
      <p>XXth February 2011</p>

      <p>This release of APSIM is a maintenance release with many defects fixed and some new functionality added. 
      </p>
     <h3><a href="http://www.apsim.info/BugTracker/bugs.aspx?qu_id=20">The complete list of defects can be found here</a></h3>

      <h2>Changes to Windows explorer menu naming</h2>
      The windows explorer context menus for apsim now include the revision number of that release. These revisions relate to the 
      <a href="http://apsrunet.apsim.info/websvn/listing.php?repname=apsim"> version control</a> system. 
      As usual, multiple versions (and now revisions) can be installed on one machine with no interferance.
      By default, APSIM now installs itself into a directory name that contains the revision number.
      For example, c:\program files\apsim73-R1031

      <h2>Changes to Apsim User Interface</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Many grid control bugs, inadvertently introduced in APSIM 7.2, have been fixed in this release.</li>
         <li>Two new options now exist on the right click context menu. The first is a convenient way to unlink 
         all nested simulation nodes with a single click. The second is a way to easily duplicate simulations 
         or paddocks a user defined number of times.</li>
         <li>An button in the user interface has been created to allow users to easily send their large collection 
         of simulations to the Toowoomba computer
         cluster. A yearly access fee is charged for this service. The fee then allows us to upgrade the cluster 
         computers. Contact apsim@dpi.qld.gov.au for more information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Changes to Apsim User Interface graphics</h2>
      <p>A component to display <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Graphics</a> in the User Interface has been implemented.</p>
