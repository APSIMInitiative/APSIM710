     <h2>Changes to "Run on Cluster" form</h2>
     <p>Cluster jobs have been rearranged. Instead of running "one simulation per CPU", the system attempts to run several simulations in parallel, using all available CPUs on a single machine, significantly reducing the amount of network traffic for each job. This changes the interpretation of "number of simulations per job" - as the throughput is now related to the number of CPU cores as well as their speed. On the toowoomba cluster, Linux hosts have 8 or 16 CPUs per machine, the Windows hosts have 12, so simply multiplying the existing number by 12 or 16 should suffice to keep runtime the same. The general principle is that the longer a job runs, the higher its throughput - as less time is spent setting up and tearing down the job. However, longer running jobs have a higher chance of being interrupted if a higher priority user enters the queue.
