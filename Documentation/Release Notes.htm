      <h1>APSIM 7.4 release notes</h1>
      <p>10th February 2012</p>

      <p>This release of APSIM is a maintenance release with many defects fixed and some new functionality added. 
      </p>
     <h3><a href="http://www.apsim.info/BugTracker/bugs.aspx?qu_id=25">The complete list of defects can be found here</a></h3>

      <h2>Manager .NET</h2>
      <p>A new Manager module has been developed that allows users to write C# or VB.NET as a scripting language. This 
         module is released along with the existing Manager module. Samples of the script can be found in the standard toolbox.
         <a href="http://www.apsim.info/Wiki/Script.ashx">Documentation can be found here</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Factorial Designs</h2>
      <p>The APSIM User Interface now has a Factorial button that allows the user to quickly specify multiple 
         variations on a base simulation. For example a sowing x variety experiment could be easily configured using 
         this system. <a href="http://www.apsim.info/Wiki/Factorial.ashx">Documentation can be found here.</a></p>
      <h2>Oryza, Rice Management Toolbox</h2>
	   <ul>
	    <li>IRRI has made major changes to their rice model that improve on the 2004 version currently in APSIM. A newer version has been developed that allows the rice "biology" to be shared between the standalone version of Oryza, <a href="http://www.icasa.net/dssat">DSSAT</a>, and APSIM. Full details of the rice biology changes are described on the <a href="http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/oryzabeta"> IRRI website </a>. This release of APSIM contains both the old (rice) 2004 version, and the newer version "Oryza2" in the developers toolbox.
	    <li> The toolbox used in the <a href="http://www.apsim.info/Wiki/Training-Manual-SAsia.ashx">South Asia Training Manual</a> is included in the standard release. 
       </ul>  
      <h2>Windows 7 issues</h2>
      <p>Several Windows 7 installation issues have been resolved, particularly on computers where the user isn't
         an "administrator" of their computer.</p>
      <h2>Foreign Locales </h2>
      <p>Several defects have been repaired relating to foreign locales (date and number formats), in particular the
         French locale.</p> 
	  
	  <h2>Behaviour of default CO2 response</h2>
	  <p>The default crop CO2 response has changed. If a simulation defines CO2 to a non-standard value (ie. other than 350ppm),	crops for which a CO2 response is not defined will throw an error.
        NB Wheat, Oats and Barley are the only APSIM crop modules that are responsive to CO2.
	  </p>
      <h2>User Interface Enhancements</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>The graphing capability of the User Interface has been improved, particularly the series colour matching and 
         legend positioning.</li>
      <li>The &quot;Run on Cluster &quot; Button has been overhauled. Details are on the <a href="http://www.apsim.info/Wiki/Running-Jobs-On-Cluster.ashx">APSIM wiki</a>.
      </li>
