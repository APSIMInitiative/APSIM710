      <h1>APSIM 7.5 release notes</h1>
      <p>12th April 2013</p>
         
      <h2>New soil XML format</h2>
      <p>The XML format (inside of .apsim and .soils files) has changed between APSIM 7.4 and 7.5. This change was 
         necessary for the migration to ApsimX. All APSIM 7.4 files (.apsim) will be converted to the new format
         automatically.<b>Note though that an APSIM 7.5 file cannot be opened in earlier versions of APSIM.</b></p>
      <p>This change has also meant that soil crop parameterisations are now part of the Water node under the soil
         node. Previously they were separates nodes under Water.</p>
      
      
      <h2>Runoff from irrigation</h2>
      <p>The irrigation / soil water module can now be told to calculate runoff from irrigation applications. 
         To turn this on, a new parameter can be set to true when applying irrigation.</p>
      <b>Old Maanager</b>
      <p>irrigation apply amount = 31 (mm), will_runoff = 1</p>
      <b>New Maanager</b>
      <p>
      IrrigationApplicationType data = new IrrigationApplicationType();<br>
      data.Amount = 31;<br>
      data.will_runoff = true;<br>
      Irrigation.Apply(data);<br>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Sub-surface trickle irrigation</h2>
      <p>Sub-surface trickle irrigation can now be specified via the apply command for the irrigation module.</p>
      <b>Old Maanager</b>
      <p>irrigation apply amount = 31 (mm), depth = 100 (mm)</p>
      <b>New Maanager</b>
      <p>
      IrrigationApplicationType data = new IrrigationApplicationType();<br>
      data.Amount = 31;<br>
      data.Depth = 100;<br>
      Irrigation.Apply(data);<br>
      </p>      
      
      
      <h2>N2O from nitrification and denitrification</h2>
      <p>Two new output variables "n2o_atm_nitrification" and "n2o_atm_denitrification" have been added to SoilN
         and SoilNitrogen. These report the amount of n2o from nitirification and denitrification.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>New Manager2 module now runs on Condor clusters</h2>
      <p>There was a bug in APSIM 7.4 that stopped the Manager2 component from running on condor execute machines due
         to them not having write access to the TEMP folder. A workaround has been implemented in APSIM 7.5.</p>


      <h2>SoilTemp module now under the Soil node</h2>
      <p>The SoilTemp and SoilTemp2 modules are now under the Soil node rather than the paddock node. This allows them
         to use the soil thickness and ParticleSizeClay values. APSIM will automatically move these modules to the soil node
         when converting a .apsim file from APSIM 7.4 to 7.5.</p>
        
         
      <h2>APSIM.exe can now run a .apsim file from command line</h2>
      <p>APSIM.exe can now be passed a .apsim, .con or .sim file on the command line. To specify a specific
         simulation in a .apsim or .con file, the command line argument Simulation=xxx can be used.</p> 
      <p>To debug from Visual Studio, execute ApsimModel.exe passing a .apsim file or .sim file as the argument.</p>
	  
      
	  <h2>APSIM User Inteface can now combine multiple .apsim files</h2>
	  <p>The user interface now has an option under the Open button to combine multiple .apsim files in to a single .apsim file.</p>
     
     
 	  <h2>The ORYZA module now shows its output variables in the APSIM User Interface</h2>
	  <p>A bug in APSIM 7.4 stopped the ORYZA rice module from showing its output variables to the user in the 
        user interface. This has now been fixed.</p>
     
     
 	  <h2>The Cotton module has been ported to C#</h2>
	  <p>The OZCot cotton module has been ported to the C# programming language. While no new science
        has been incorporated, the new language allows for much easier future development.

     <h2>The Sugar module is now responsive to CO2</h2>
	  <p>The source code and XML file for the Sugar module has been changed to allow CO2 levels to affect 
        the growth of sugarcane.</p>
     <p>Biggs, J.S., P.J. Thorburn, S. Crimp, B. Masters, and S.J. Attard. 2012. 
        “Interactions between climate change and sugarcane management systems for improving water quality leaving 
        farms in the Mackay Whitsunday region, Australia.”
