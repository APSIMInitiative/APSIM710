      <h1>APSIM 7.0 release notes</h1>
      <p>24th April 2009</p>

      <h2>Directory restructure</h2>
      <p>The installed APSIM directory structure has changed. Under c:\program files\apsim70, there
         are directories called Model (for all binaries), Documentation, Examples and User Interface
         (for all user interface files). This change has resulted in a much smaller installation
         as the full testing suite no longer needs to be installed on users computers.</p>

      <h2>New module names</h2>
      <p>Several APSIM modules have been renamed.
         <ul>
            <li>SoilWat2 becomes SoilWat</li>
            <li>SoilN2 becomes SoilN</li>
            <li>Fertiliz becomes Fertiliser</li>
            <li>PigeonP becomes PigeonPea</li>
            <li>Irrigate becomes Irrigation</li>
            <li>Operatns becomes Operations</li>
            <li>APSwim becomes SWIM2</li>
            <li>SoilT becomes SurfaceTemp</li>
         </ul>
         These changes will have no impact on those using the APSIM user interface. For those users
         who use CON/PAR files, their files will be automatically upgraded to use the new names.
      </p>

      <h2>APSIM runtime speed</h2>
      <p>APSIM 6.1 was somewhat slower at running simulations than APSIM 6.0. This has now been fixed
      so that APSIM 7 runtime speed is similar to APSIM 6.0.</p>

      <h2>PLANT2</h2>
      <p>Migration of the existing generic PLANT model to C#.net has begun. Currently two experimental
      crops (vine and broccoli) are now operating in PLANT2.</p>


      <h2>PLANT</h2>
      <p>The ongoing development of PLANT has now moved to maintenance only. All new development efforts
      now focus on PLANT2.</p>


      <h2>User Interface</h2>
      <p><ul>
         <li>An APSIM.info Google web search capability has been added to the user interface under the help menu.</li>
         <li>The link to ApsimOutlook has been removed from the user interface and replaced with a new
            "Insert New Graph" button.</li>
         <li>Many new examples have been added to the user interface eg. upland and paddy rice simulations.</li>
         <li>The Memo component in the user interface is now plain text so that the search capability can
             search for the text within the component.</li>
         <li>In ApsimUI the predicted LL values for vertosols are now used if necessary when running APSIM.</li>
         <li>In ApsimUI, multiple reporting frequencies are now supported and work correctly.</li>
         <li>The graphics capability of the user interface has been reworked making it more flexible.</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Charts can now be printed and exported to bitmap files.</li>
               <li>Predicted / Observed charts are now supported. </li>
               <li>Cumulative plots are now supported.</li>
               <li>Depth plots have been fixed</li>
               <li>Multiple plots are now supported on a single chart</li>
               <li>Multiple charts can now be inserted on a report</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>New Graph option in Windows Explorer</h2>
      <p>A new graph option is now available in Windows Explorer when right clicking on .out files. This will
         load a new "ApsimGraph" package that allows you to build charts in a similar manner to APSVis. This
         package uses the same technology as the APSIM user interface. Graphs can be copied and pasted to
         simulation files if nedded.</p>

      <h2>SoilWat</h2>
      <p>A new runoff event has been added to SoilWat</p>

      <h2>Oryza</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>SWIM capability has been added to Oryza.</li>
         <li>Fix for cold temperature and grain sterility bugs.</li>
         <li>Fix for spikelet sterility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Graz</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Dead stems are now eaten properly.</li>
         <li>Supplements can be set from manager.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AusFarm STOCK and PASTURE</h2>
      <p>The APSIM user interface examples that use the STOCK and PASTURE models from AusFarm have
         been simplified making it easier to use these components. NB: AusFarm will need to be
         licensed and installed before running these models.</p>


      <h2>Incorp FOM event</h2>
      <p>The IncorpFOM (fresh organic matter) event has been redesigned and made more protocol friendly.
         Earlier versions of APSIM used the difficult ApsimVariant class for this event. Now a
         standard structure is used, making it easier to pick up in .NET and other models.</p>

      <h2>.NET component support</h2>
      <p>Considerable work has gone into simplifying the development of .NET components in APSIM.
         <a href="http://www.apsim.info/Apsim/Documents/Developing Models For APSIM.pdf">A document</a> has been
         developed that describes the process of writing a .NET module for APSIM.</p>


      <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>There have been several fixes for multi-paddock gets and sets.</p>

      <h2>MAKE files</h2>
      <p>All MAKE files in the build are now much simpler and directly support LINUX and WINDOWS build from
         a single MAKE file.</p>

      <h2>APSIM Outlook</h2>
      <p>APSIM Outlook is now longer released in APSIM and is not supported the the Software Engineering Group.
         All graph types can now be reproduced within the APSIM User Interface.</p>
