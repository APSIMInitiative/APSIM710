      <p>XXXX 2013</p>

     <h2>Changes to "user_defined" tillage</h2>
	  <p>The SurfaceOM and Soilwat modules treat arguments to the tillage event slightly differently. Both modules
	    accept an optional "type" parameter that can be used as a key in a lookup table of tillage parameters. To now, 
	    if this key was defined and had an entry in the table, then the optional parameters (f_incorp, cn_red etc)
	    were used as overides if they were defined. Using structures in these events instead of 
	    ApsimVariants loses the ability to define optional parameters. So now, if the key is defined, it must 
	    specify a valid section in the table, or the special key "user_defined" which will skip reading the table, and 
	    the module will use whatever parameters the user specifies. Any parameter that isnt defined it is either zero 
	    or blank.</p>
	  <p>.NET and CI2 modules that use structures (cf. ApsimVariant) to pass the message have no way to specify
	    optional parameters, and are unaffected.
	</p>
