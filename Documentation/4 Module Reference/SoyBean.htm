<p class="Title1">The APSIM Soybean Module -(soybean)</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal"><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p class="Normal">The soybean module was developed Michael Robertson with contributions from Peter Carberry. APSIM-Soybean belongs to the PLANT family of crop modules in APSIM. The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM-Soybean. This document outlines some soybean-specific issues that are not covered by the legume science document. </p>
<p class="Normal">Notable features of APSIM-SOYBEAN </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The phenology of soybean cultivars are responsive to temperature and photoperiod, but not vernalisation. There is no photoperiod effect on post-flowering duration, even though it is known that such an effect exists. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">There are a limited number of cultivars available and users should consult the module owner if they need advice specifying a new cultivar</p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Account is taken of the energy costs involved in synthesising the high energy content grain in soybean. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Oil content is not simulated dynamically in response to any cultivar or environmental effects. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">APSIM-Soybean is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate the differences between determinant and indeterminant types in terms of canopy expansion and flowering. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes </p>
<p class="Normal">There are two crop classes. One is the conventional type, and the other is a promiscuous nodulator, often grown in the developing world. The promiscuous crop class has low N fixation capacity. </p>
<p class="Normal">There are 8 cultivars able to be simulated: Davis, Buchanan, CPI26671, Durack, Valiant, Roan, Magoye and Dragon. Cultivars differ in terms of biomass partitioning to grain and phenology. Cultivar Magoye, listed below, is a promiscuous type. It has a lower harvest index. </p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Validation </p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Soybean has received testing across northern Australia, with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, plant population density row spacing varying. Papers describing validation of APSIM-Soybean are by Robertson and Carberry (1998) and Denner et al. (1998). The accompanying figure demonstrates the performance of the module against Australian datasets. </p>
