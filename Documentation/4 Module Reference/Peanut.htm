<p class="Title1">The APSIM Peanut Module – (peanut)</p>

<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>

<p class="Normal">The
peanut module was developed by Michael Robertson with contributions of data
from Graeme Wright, RCN Rao and Mike Bell (QDPI) Kingaroy. The module was
developed from the original QNUT model (Hammer et al. 1995) with numerous
enhancements. The model is described in the paper by Robertson et al. (2002).
The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a
comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM – Peanut. This document
outlines some peanut-specific issues that are not covered by the plant science
document. </p>

<p class="Title2">NOTABLE FEATURES OF APSIM-PEANUT</p>
<p class="Normal">
The
phenology of peanut cultivars is responsive to temperature, but not to
photoperiod and vernalisation </p>

<p class="Normal">
However,
harvest index of peanut cultivar is adversely sensitive to long photoperiods.</p>

<p class="Normal">
Water
deficit effects on phenology have been incorporated.</p>

<p class="Normal">
Account
is taken of the energy cost involved in synthesizing the high-energy content
grain in peanut.</p>

<p class="Normal">
Oil
content is not simulated dynamically in response to any cultivar or
environmental effects. </p>

<p class="Normal">
APSIM-peanut
is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development.</p>

<p class="Normal">
Crop
growth is not sensitive to waterlogging.</p>

<p class="Normal">
The
module does not simulate the differences between bunch and runner types in
terms of canopy expansion and indeterminacy.</p>


<p class="Title2">CULTIVARS AND CROP CLASSES</p>

<p class="Normal">There
is one crop class.</p>


<p class="Normal">There
are 9 cultivars able to be simulated: Early bunch, Virginia bunch, Streeton,
McCubbin, Chico, NC7, VB97, Florunner, Conder. Cultivars differ in terms of
biomass partitioning to grain and phenology.</p>

<p class="Title2">WATER DEFICIT
AFFECTING PHENOLOGY  </p>

<p class="Normal">Observations
made in Burnett district in the Southeast Queensland, Australia and elsewhere,
have shown that severe water deficits delayed flowering and maturity of
Virginia peanut cultivars. The APSIM peanut model has been parameterised to
account for phenological sensitivity to severe water deficits at different
stages and a recovery upon this stress being relieved either by rain or
irrigation. </p>
<p class="Normal">A
water availability ratio is calculated by dividing actual soil water supply (sw
– ll) by the potential soil water supply (dul – ll). This ratio is used in the
relationship illustrated in the Figure 1 to derive a stress factor for
phenological development. A factor of 0 is complete stress and 1 no stress.
This enables slowing down of thermal time addition whenever water availability
ratio declines to less than 0.29.  </p>

<pre> 
x_sw_avail_ratio  = 0.16  0.29 1.0 ()    ! water availability
y_swdef_pheno     = 0.55  1.0  1.0 ()    ! stress index for phenology
x_sw_avail_ratio_flower =  0.16  0.29  1.0 () ! water availability
y_swdef_pheno_flower    =  0.55  1.0   1.0  ()! stress index for flowering
x_sw_avail_ratio_grainfill = 0.16  0.29   1.0  () ! water availability
y_swdef_pheno_grainfill    = 0.55  1.0    1.0  () ! stress index for grain filling

<p class="Title2">PHOTOPERIOD AFFECTING HARVEST INDEX </p>

<p class="Normal">Although peanut has been presumed to be
day-neutral with respect to flowering, more recently it has been demonstrated
that continuous photoperiod significantly reduces harvest index (Rowell et al.
1999).    To account for photoperiod
effects on harvest index, changes in maximum potential harvest index have been
made. The maximum harvest index (pod yield / biomass) under continuous
photoperiod (24 h) has been parameterised as 45% and under 1 h photoperiod as
75%.  </p>

<p class="Title2">VALIDATION</p>

<p class="Normal">The
APSIM –Peanut has received testing across northern Australia with factors such
as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, plant population density,
and  row spacing varying.   Figure 2 demonstrates the performance of
the module against Australian datasets. </p>
