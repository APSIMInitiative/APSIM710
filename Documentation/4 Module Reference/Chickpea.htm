<p class="Title1">The APSIM Chickpea Module - (chickpea)</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>

<p class="Normal">The chickpea module was developed by Peter Carberry, Jill Turpin and Michael Robertson, with contributions of data 
  from Bob Brinsmead and Harry Marcellos. The module is described in the paper by Robertson et al. (2002).  
  This module is being updated by work conducted by Jeremy Whish at APSRU. The reader is referred to 
  the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM-Chickpea.  This document 
  outlines some chickpea-specific issues that are not covered by the plant science document.</p>

<p class="Title2">Notable features of APSIM-CHICKPEA</p>

<ul>
 <li class="Normal"> The Module simulates dsi types of cultivars</li>
 <li class="Normal">The phenology of chickpea cultivars is responsive to temperature and photoperiod, but not vernalisation. Model 
   performance on days to flowering was reported by Carberry (1996) and is repeated in the graph below (Figure 1).</li>
 <li class="Normal">The module does not simulate production from second and further flushes of flowers and pods.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Under well-watered conditions, chickpea may have a low harvest index due to continued vegetative growth at the expense 
   of reproductive yield.  The model does not currently simulate this phenomenon.</li>
 <li class="Normal">When chickpea flowers and attempts to set pods under cold conditions, pod set can be delayed until temperatures rise above a critical threshold. This phenomenon is not simulated in this module.</li>
 <li class="Normal">APSIM-Chickpea is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>

<p class="Normal">There is one crop class.</p>
<p class="Normal">There are 6 cultivars able to be simulated: Amethyst, CPI56288, Dooen, Tyson, CV244-1, CPI56566. Cultivars differ in terms 
  of biomass partitioning to grain and phenology. If users wish to use more modern cultivars they should contact Jeremy Whish at APSRU for advice.</p>

<p class="Normal">Figure 2: Performance of the chickpea module (observed versus simulated grain yield  in g/m2) against test datasets 
  reported by Robertson et al. (2002).</p>

<p class="Title2">Validation</p>

<p class="Normal">APSIM-Chickpea has received testing across the northern Australian wheat belt, with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, 
  irrigation, soil type, row spacing varying. Some testing has occurred in Wa as well. Limited testing has been conducted under dryland conditions in Syria (Moeller 2004).    Papers describing validation of APSIM-chickpea are by Carberry (1996) and Robertson et al. 
  (2002).  The accompanying figure 2 demonstrates the performance of the module against Australian datasets.</p>

<p class="Title2">
IN WHICH ENVIRONMENTS THIS MODULE SHOULD BE USED WITH CONFIDENCE?</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Chickpea can be used with most confidence in the semi-arid sub-tropics of northern Australia, the Western Australian wheat belt, and with less confidence in dryland environments of the Mediterranean.</p>
