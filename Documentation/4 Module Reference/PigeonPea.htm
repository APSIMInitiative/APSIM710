<p class="Title1">The APSIM Pigeonpea Module -(pigeonpea)</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Normal">The pigeonpea module was developed by Michael Robertson and Peter Carberry at APSRU, and YS Chauhan, R Ranganathan, and G O'Leary of ICRISAT. APSIM-Pigeonpea belongs to the LEGUME family of crop modules in APSIM. The reader is referred to the science document for the legume module for a comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM-Pigeonpea and to Robertson et al. (2001) for parameter derivation and model testing. This document outlines some pigeonpea-specific issues that are not covered by the legume science document. </p>

<p class="Title2">Notable features of APSIM-PIGEONPEA</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The phenology of pigeonpea cultivars are responsive to temperature and photoperiod, but not vernalisation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">APSIM-Pigeonpea is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>
<p class="Normal">There is one crop class. </p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">There are three generic cultivars able to be simulated: extra short duration, short duration and medium duration. A long duration type was not able to be parameterised due to lack of data, however the module owner would be able to give advice on a long duration type if this were required by a user. Cultivar types differ in terms of biomass partitioning to grain and phenology. </p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Validation</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Pigeonpea has received testing in Central India , with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, plant population density, row spacing varying. Validation of APSIM-Pigeonpea is described by Robertson et al. (2001). The accompanying figure demonstrates the performance of the module for grain yield and biomass.</p>
