<p class="Title1">The APSIM horsegram Module</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Normal">The horsegram module was developed by Dr R. Selvaraju, building largely on the mungbean module developed by
Peter Carberry and Michael Robertson . 
The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes 
simulated by APSIM-horsegram. This document outlines some horsegram-specific issues that are 
not covered by the plant science document.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">The horsegram module simulates horsegram (black gram or green gram). </p>
<p class="Normal">Notable features of APSIM-horsegram</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The phenology of horsegram cultivars are photoperiod insensitive. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate grain weathering, although some users have simulated the number of rainfall events during pod-fill (using the manager module) and used this as a surrogate of weathering damage. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate production from second and further flushes of flowers and pods. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">APSIM-horsegram is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Cultivars </p>
<p class="Normal">There are 2 cultivars able to be simulated: CO1 and Paiyur. Cultivars differ in terms of <i>biomass partitioning to grain and phenology</i>. </p>
<p class="Title2">Validation</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-horsegram has received testing in Tamil Nadu, with factors such as <i>cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, row spacing varying</i>. </p>

<p class="Title2">In Which Environments Should This Module Be Used With Confidence?</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-horsegram can be used with a high degree of confidence in South India.</p>
