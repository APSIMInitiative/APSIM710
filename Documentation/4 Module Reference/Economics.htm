<p class="Title1">The APSIM economics Module</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title2">Applicability</p>
<p class="Normal"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p class="Normal">The economics module in APSIM was developed primarily to serve as another
input to the management module - as an index of farm "stress" that modifies the risk
aversion of the farm manager. To this end, it simply maintains a cash balance through 
the simulation, which monitors all financial activity (eg. income, expenses, loan repayments).</p>

<p class="Normal">The bottom line is that all events that occur on a farm have a cost, and 
these events MUST be captured by the economics module for a realistic simulation. This includes 
not only crop income & expenses, but also annual operating expenses and capital replacement. 
</p>

<p class="title2">Operation</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">As with all apsim modules, the economics module responds to events. 
The main events of interest are &quot;income&quot; and &quot;expenditure&quot; events. The module will 
generate an "end_financial_year" event that other modules may have an interest in, internally
it will calculate loan repayments on this date.</p>

<p class="Normal">Typically, these events are generated from within the manager module, 
for instance when sowing or harvesting a crop, preparing a seedbed, spraying for 
weeds and so on. The events contain parameters; typically most define a rate, category and area. 
The module will write a line to the summary file describing the outcome of the event, and alos a line in 
the cash journal.
</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal"><b><i>expenditure events</i></b></p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">
  economics expenditure category = seedcost, name = wheat, rate = 120 (kg/ha), area = 200 (ha)<br>
</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">Here the module will look up the entry "wheat" in its "seedcost" section, multiply 
by rate by area and subtract the total from the current balance. Note that while units are specified, 
<b>no unit conversion</b> is performed. As well the paddock area must be specified.
</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal"><b><i>income events</i></b></p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">
  cropyieldTONNES = wheat.yield / 1000.0<br>
  protein = wheat.grain_protein<br>
  economics income category= cropprice, name = wheat, yield = cropyieldTONNES, protein = protein, area = 200 (ha)<br>
...<br>
  cropyieldTONNES = sorghum.yield / 1000.0<br>
  economics income category= cropprice, name = sorghum, yield = cropyieldTONNES, area = 200 (ha)<br>
</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">The first example shows the manager calculating a crop yield in tonnes and grain 
protein content, then telling the economics module (wheat price is dependant on quality). The second is a simpler 
version of the same.
</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title2">Capital replacement</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">The simulation starts with an initial capital investment loan. All machinery 
items have an initial age, and are replaced when they exceeds thier useful life. Payments for these 
loans are made at the end of each financial year.
</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title2">Additional machinery</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">Additional machinery is created by duplicating an existing node in the the 
ApsimUI tree. Simply rename the node, and check that the &quot;Apsim Name&quot; is unique.
