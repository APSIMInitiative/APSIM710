<p class="Title1">The APSIM Canola Module -   (Canola)</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>

<p class="Normal">The canola module was developed by Michael Robertson in conjunction with Chris Smith (CSIRO Land 
  and Water), John Holland (NSW Agriculture) and John Kirkegaard (CSIRO Plant Industry).  Further testing has been 
  conducted by Imma Farre (CSIRO Plant Industry). The module is described in the paper by Robertson et al. (1999).  
  The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the 
  processes simulated by APSIM-Canola. This document outlines some canola-specific issues that are not covered by 
the plant science document.</p>
<p class="Normal">The canola module simulates canola (Brassica napus) and the related species Indian mustard (Brassica juncea).</p>

<p class="Title2">Notable features of APSIM-Canola</p>


<ul>
 <li class="Normal">The phenology of canola cultivars respond to vernalisation and photoperiod (daylength).</li>
 <li class="Normal">In the module, all green leaf area senesces soon after flowering and photosynthesis is then conducted by the pods.</li>
 <li class="Normal">APSIM-Canola is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to row spacing</li>
 <li class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>

<p class="Normal">There are three crop classes:</p>
<ul><li class="Normal">Conventional canola</li>
<li class="Normal">Triazine tolerant canola – this crop class has a radiation use efficiency 20% less than the conventional type</li>
 <li class="Normal">Winter canola – this is designed to simulate European types, but has received limited testing.  It differs from
    the conventional crop class in that it has a different sensitivity of leaf senescence to frost and a different rate of leaf 
	senescence due to ageing.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Normal">There are 14 conventional cultivars: PacN145, Monty, Hyola42, Surpass400, Rainbow, Mystic, Narendra, Surpass600, 
  Geordie, Oscar, Marnoo, Eureka, Charlton, Clancy, Dunkeld</p>
<p class="Normal">There are three triazine-tolerant cultivars: Karoo, Drum, Pinnacle</p>
<p class="Normal">There are two mustards: JL1, 397</p>
<p class="Normal">There are four generic cultivars: early, mid and late maturing, and a mustard</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">NOTE: there is no explicit linking of crop classes with cultivars in APSIM-Canola, so the user must be aware to 
  specify the triazine-tolerant class, for instance, if they are using a triazine-tolerant cultivar.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Validation</p>

<p class="Normal">APSIM-Canola has received testing across the Australian wheat belt, with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, 
  N supply, irrigation, soil type varying. Papers describing validation of APSIM-Canola are by Robertson et al. (1999), Robertson et 
  al. (2001), and Farre et al (2001).  The following two figures demonstrate the performance of the module against Australian datasets.</p>

<p class="Normal">Figure 1: Observed and predicted (a) grain yield (oven-dry) at maturity and, (b) total biomass at maturity for datasets 
  presented by Robertson et al (1999). The line is the 1:1 relationship.  The model was tested against independent datasets from Australia 
  (26 to 36<sup>o</sup> latitude), which varied in terms of nitrogen supply, water supply, sowing date, and variety.  Grain yields, 
  ranging from 30 to 500 gm<sup>-2</sup>, were simulated with a root mean squared deviation of 45 gm<sup>-2</sup> (15% of the observed mean).</p>
