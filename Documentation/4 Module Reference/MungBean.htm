<p class="Title1">The APSIM Mungbean Module</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Normal">The mungbean module was developed by Peter Carberry and Michael Robertson . The module is described in the paper by Robertson et al. (2002). The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM-Mungbean. This document outlines some mungbean-specific issues that are not covered by the plant science document.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">The mungbean module simulates mungbean (black gram or green gram). </p>
<p class="Normal">Notable features of APSIM-MUNGBEAN</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The phenology of mungbean cultivars are photoperiod insensitive. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate grain weathering, although some users have simulated the number of rainfall events during pod-fill (using the manager module) and used this as a surrogate of weathering damage. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate production from second and further flushes of flowers and pods. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">APSIM-Mungbean is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>
<p class="Normal">There is one crop class.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">There are 9 cultivars able to be simulated: King, Berken, Satin, Shantung , Emerald, Green Diamond, Delta, Putland, Celera. Cultivars differ in terms of biomass partitioning to grain and phenology. </p>

<p class="Normal">Figure 1: Performance of the mungbean module (observed versus simulated grain yield in g/m2) against test datasets reported by Robertson et al. (2002). </p>
<p class="Title2">Validation</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Mungbean has received testing across the northern Australian wheatbelt, with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, row spacing varying. Papers describing validation of APSIM-Mungbean are by Robertson et al. (2000) and Robertson et al. (2002). The accompanying figure demonstrates the performance of the module against Australian datasets. </p>
<p class="Title2">In Which Environments Should This Module Be Used With Confidence?</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Mungbean can be used with a high degree of confidence in northern Australia.</p>
