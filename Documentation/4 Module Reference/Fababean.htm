<p class="Title1">The APSIM Fababean Module (fababean)</p>

<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The fababean module was developed by Michael Robertson and
Jill Turpin, with contributions from Bill Bellotti, Ian Rose, Andrew Moore, and
KM Siddique. The module is described in the paper by Turpin et al. (2003).  The reader is referred to the science
document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes
simulated by APSIM-Fababean.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">This document outlines some fababean-specific issues that
are not covered by the plant science document.</p>

<p class="Title2">Notable features of APSIM-FABABEAN</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Module simulates small-seeded types of cultivars</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The phenology of fababean cultivars is responsive to
temperature and photoperiod, but not vernalisation.  There is an effect of photoperiod on post-flowering development.
Model performance on days to flowering was reported by Turpin et al. (2003) and
is repeated in the graph below (Figure 1).</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The module does not simulate production from second and
further flushes of flowers and pods.</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under well-watered conditions, fababean may have a low
harvest index due to continued vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive
yield.  The model does not currently
simulate this phenomenon.</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
APSIM-Fababean is not phosphorus-responsive, this is
currently under development.</p>

<p class="Normal">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging.</p>

<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">There is one crop class.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">There are 6 cultivars able to be simulated: Amethyst,
CPI56288, Dooen, Tyson, CV244-1, CPI56566. Cultivars differ in terms of biomass
partitioning to grain and phenology. If usrs wish to use more modern cultivars
they should contact Jeremy Whish at APSRU for advice.</p>

Turpin et al. (2003).</p>

<p class="Title2">Validation</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">APSIM-Fababean has received testing across the Australian
wheat belt, with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type,
row spacing varying. Some testing has occurred in WA as well as Victoria,
Queensland and northern NSW. The accompanying figure 2 demonstrates the
performance of the module against Australian datasets.</p>

<p class="Title2">IN Which environments THIS MODULE should be used with confidence?</p>

<p class="Normal">APSIM-Fababean can be used with most confidence in the
semi-arid sub-tropics of northern Australia, the Western Australian wheat belt,
and the dryland environments of the Mediterranean-type regions. The module has
received limited testing under irrigation on black cracking clay soils of
northern NSW.</p>
