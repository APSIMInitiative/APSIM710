<h1>SOI phase and Economic analysis</h1>

<p>In this exercise, you will examine the effect of SOI phase on yield 
probability, and gross margin outcomes. Exercises will also be conducted using 
manual generation of a probability distribution and the application of economic 
principles.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new simulation using <i>Continuous Wheat Simulation</i>.</li>
  <li>Rename simulation to <i>Wheat_SOI_s</i></li>
  <li>Choose Goondiwindi weather (long term 1940 to 1989) </li>
  <li>Starting date 01/01/1940 Ending date 31/12/1989</li>
  <li>Choose "Black Vertosol-Anchorfield (Brookstead No006)" soil. (remember to rename)</li>
  <li>Set the starting soil water to 33% full &#8211; filled from the top</li>
  <li>Use default initial soil nitrogen</li>
  <li>Set initial surface organic matter is sorghum and is 1500 kg/ha. (rename the pool name, but leave everything else)</li>
  <li>Modify sowing rule to:<br>
<p>Force sowing to 10-Dec <br>
Enter sowing density at 5 pl/m2<br>
Cultivar as medium<br>
Skip row as soild<br>
(leave everything else as is)
</p>
</li>
<li>Set fertiliser at sowing to 100 kg/ha of urea_no3. (move this rule up so that it comes before harvesting rule)</li>
<li>From the Standard toolbox drag in a "Yield moisture correction" and a "Simple gross margin (put before harvesting rule)" rule. 
(make sure the "Yield moisture correction" rule comes before the "Simple gross margin" which obviously comes before the harvest rule)
<li>Report year, yield and Bank in the output file. (Just type "Bank" in manually into the variable list)</li>
<li>Create a <i>linked</i> copy of this simulation via drag and drop and rename this new one 
to <i>Sorghum_SOI_skip</i> (to find out how to do this see: 
<a href="..\3 How To\Use linking to reduce simulation duplication.htm">How To: Use linking to reduce simulation duplication</a>)</li>
<li><i>Unlink</i> the sowing rule and change it to double skip </li>
<li>Run both simulations (check the simulations run error-free) </li>

<li>Graph Yield of both simulations using an <i>SOI Box Plot</i> from the Graph toolbox. (There is an error in the "Phase filename" you need to
change it so that it is <i>%apsuite\Soi\phases.soi</i>, we will fix this in the next release.)</li>
<li>We want to look at the Yield in the Box Plot so tick "Yield" in the FieldNames
<li>Given we used a sowing date of December, use the SOI from November to split 
the years. ("Month" drop down list)</li>
<li>Deselect all SOI phases except negative and positive Years</li>
<li>You will notice that the labels on the X axis can not be read, so expand the width of the graph until they become readable (to find out how to do this see: 
<a href="..\3 How To\Modify a Graph component.htm">How To: Modify a Graph component</a>)</li>



<p><img src="7%20SOI%20phase%20and%20Economic%20Analysis_files/image1.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>The output demonstrates the differing probability distributions of solid vs 
double skip configuration in negative and positive SOI phases <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<li>Compare with "SOI CDF" and "SOI Probability Exceedence" graphs. (If you notice that when you click on something else and click 
back on the graph it has disappeared, just tick the "Yield" in the FieldNames. This is another error that will be fixed in the next release) </li>

</ol>

<h3>Economic analysis</h3>



  <p>This simulation has two rules from the Standard toolbox that we dragged in. A "Yield moisture correction" and a 
  "Simple gross margin" rule.</p> 
  <p>You also remember how you manually typed in Bank into the output variable list. 
  To see where it comes from click on the "post" tab of the "Simple gross margin" rule.</p>
  <p>You can create your own economic calculations by using these kind of manager rules.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind though when using these rules, that yield in APSIM is calculated as <i>dry</i> yield. So this assumes no water content.
  Much economic analysis requires a <i>wet</i> yield which is what a farmer will actually harvest from his paddock. This is why in our simulations
  we used a "Yield moisture correction" to do a simple calculation to work out this wet yield. (see its "start_of_day" tab) </p>
 <ol> 
  <li>Graph gross margin using the SOI graphs you have already created. (In FieldNames untick Yield, and tick Bank)</li>

  <li>Change the Y axis title to "Gross Margin".

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Note</b>: Similar output can be obtained via the WhopperCropper program 
  that allows selection of the required input variables from a pre-determined 
  set (usually 3 to 6 options for each variable).</li>
</ol>  

  
  
  <h3>Further economic analysis in Excel</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Select the top component <i>Simulations</i> then click the <i>Excel</i> button on the top toolbar.</li>
<li>You will notice that the output files have been exported to 2 separate Excel windows.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
 <li> *** At this point you can manipulate the data however you like in the EXCEL program ***<br>
