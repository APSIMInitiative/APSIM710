<h1>Fallow Water Balance</h1>
<p>In this exercise you will explore the major elements of interest in soil
water balance during a fallow - soil water storage, drainage, runoff, and
evaporation. Changes will be examined over a one year period in the Dalby area.</p>
<p>The examples assume you have read and walked through the previous document:
<a href="..\1 Introduction\2 How to Build, Run and Graph a Simulation.htm">How to Build, Run and Graph a Simulation</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new simulation using <i>Continuous Wheat Simulation</i> as a starting
point.</li>
  <li>Choose Goondiwindi weather (c:\program files\apsim61\apsim\met\sample)</li>
  <li>Starting date: 1/1/1989 Ending date: 31/12/1989</li>
  <li>Drag a  "Grey Vertosol-Cecilvale (Brookstead No004)" soil onto the simulation, removing the
  old soil (You can find it under Soils->Australia->Queensland->Darling Downs). Rename the soil to something short like "Soil".
  If you like you can also reorder the soil component so it comes straight under the paddock.</li>
  <li>Set the starting water to 10% full - filled from the top.</li>
  <li>Set the starting NO<sub>3</sub> to 50.34 (kg/ha) and starting NH<sub>4</sub> to 3.23
  (kg/ha).
  </li>
  <li>Check that the default initial residue type is wheat and the mass is 1000
  kg/ha.</li>
<li>Delete the <i>Fertiliser</i>, <i>Wheat</i> and <i>Manager</i> components
  out of the simulation. They are not needed for a fallow run.</li>
  <li>Choose these variables to report (removing old ones):<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" id="AutoNumber1" width="64%" border="1" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="223">

  </li>
    <li>Choose a daily reporting frequency for the output file. This can be found
  under <i>Global</i> in the variables and events tree.</li>
  
  <li>Rename the simulation to something more meaningful: <i>
  Brookstead
  Fallow.
  </i></li>
  <li>Save the simulation file as <i>Fallow.apsim</i></li>
  <li>Run the simulation.</li>
  <li>Graph the output file by going clicking on the <i>Graph </i>button. This will load the output file into APSVis. Use a Scatter Chart to plot Date vs ESW.</li>
  <li>Once you have created a chart it is then possible to make modifications by
  pressing the modify chart properties icon <img src="1%20Fallow%20Water%20Balance_files/image1.jpg"  border="0" >. Add rain as the Y2 variable and
  check the Y2 axis box and choose the chart type as the first bar chart in the drop down list.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>This will create a chart in APSVis with date, esw, rain on the X,Y,Y2
axis respectively. This plot should show the ESW (in mm) increasing with day of
year. The sudden increases are due to rainfall events and the declines to
evaporation and drainage loss. Daily rainfall will show this more clearly.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.&nbsp; Create a new graph by clicking the new scatter chart
icon <img src="1%20Fallow%20Water%20Balance_files/image2.jpg"  border="0" >. Plot Date vs runoff. Choose the chart type as the first bar chart in the drop down list.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; Now add rain to this chart using the Y2 option. Once again choose the chart type as the first bar chart in the drop down list.</p>

<h3>The effect of runoff on the water balance. </h3>
<p><br>
Runoff is affected by weather and soil water storage capacity. This run will
take an additional soil into account, and compare runoff from both soil types.
The user interface still contains all the specifications provided for the
previous simulation. </p>
<p>If you drag the <i>Brookstead Fallow </i>node in the Simulation Tree to the
top node <i>Simulations</i>), a copy of it will be made and your file will then
have 2 simulations in it. e.g.</p>
<p><img src="1%20Fallow%20Water%20Balance_files/image3.jpg" border="0" ></p>
<p>This second simulation can then be modified to add the characteristics of a
Macalister, Bongeen soil.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag the "Black Vertosol-Bongeen (Macalister No026)" soil onto the paddock in the
  simulation tree (located under Soils->Australia->Queensland->Darling Downs) and then remove the old soil . It is important you drag in a
  new soil <b>BEFORE</b> you delete the old one, otherwise the simulation will
  lose all your soil reporting variables. Also remember to rename your soil to something shorter.</li>
  <li>Since now we have a new soil we will need to go and set the initial soil water (InitWater) to 10% filled from top and initial soil nitrogen (InitNitrogen) to NO3 to 50.340 kg/ha and NH4 to 3.230 kg/ha.
  When you delete soils you also delete the initial soil water conditions and initial soil nitrogen conditions  so these
  will need to be set to the same conditions as the "Grey Vertosol-Cecilvale (Brookstead No004)" soil.</li>
  <li>Rename the simulation to <i>Bongeen
  Fallow</i>.</li>
  <li>Save the simulations </li>
  <li>Run APSIM.</li>
  <li>Graph both the output files by selecting the top node <i>Simulations</i> in the simulation tree and then clicking on the <i>Graph </i>button.
  This will load all output files into APSVis.</li>
  <li>Use a Scatter Chart to plot day vs runoff. Leave the "Chart type" drop down list to it's default and click the 'Accumulate Y' check box.</li>
  <li>Once again modify the chart to add rain as the Y2 variable, check the Y2 axis box and choose the chart type as the first bar chart in the drop down list.
