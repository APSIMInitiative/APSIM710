<H1>Adding crop properties to a soil</H1>
<p>It is important to remember that the soil must be parameterised for the crops
that you're going to sow. If your simulation is going to sow wheat, then the
soil must have LL, KL and XF values for wheat.</p>

<p> If the soil you wish to use does not have these values for the crop you desire, then you can add them.</p>
 
<p>Start by clicking on the soil component in your simulation tree, make sure the <i>Water</i> 
tab is selected, then click the "Manage crops" button.</P>

<p><img src="Adding crop properties to a soil_files/image1.png"  border="0" ></p>

<p>You click on the crop names to edit or delete and type in a blank box to 
create a new crop. It must match the name of the crop component that you are 
going to drag onto the simulation tree. Click OK. </p>

<p> You can now type in values for LL, KL and XF. PAWC is calculated for you.

<p><b>Note</b>, you can copy and paste these values from other crops by selecting all the cells you want to copy with the mouse,
and then pressing "Ctrl + C" and then clicking on the top cell of the LL column for the new crop you have added, then pressing "Ctrl + V".</p>

<p>You can find out more about LL, PAWC, KL and XF in the Science Documentation for <a href="http://www.apsim.info/apsim/publish/apsimui/types.xml#soil"> Soil</a>.
