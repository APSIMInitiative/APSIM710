<H1>Create your own or Add someone else's toolbox</H1>
<P>Quite often you may find yourself parameterising components the same way over 
and over again in your simulations. The user interface allows you to easily 
reuse these components in many simulations via your own toolboxes. You can 
create your personal toolbox and then drag components or even entire simulations 
to it. Next time you want to create a simulation or a part of a simulation, you 
can then goto your toolbox and reuse entities that you've used before.</P>
<P>Toolboxes can also allow you to save and reuse soils that you have created, 
although these should be kept in a seperate toolbox to your simulations.</P>
<P>You can also add toolboxes that other people have created, allowing you to 
quickly and easily collaborate with colleagues.</P>


<h3>Create your own toolbox</h3>
<P>To create a new empty toolbox, either for simulations or for soils, click the 
<I>Manage</I> button on the toolbar at the bottom of the 
window.</P>
<P><IMG src="Create your own or Add someones toolbox_files/image1.jpg" 
border=0></P>

 
<p> Click the <I>Create a new empty toolbox</I> link.</P>

<P><IMG src="Create your own or Add someones toolbox_files/image2.jpg" 
border=0></P>

<P>The window will let you specify the location and filename for the new empty 
toolbox. It is recommended that you keep your toolboxes in a folder <I>not</I> 
under the APSIM installation directory. Perhaps you could create a folder called 
<I>c:/apsim_toolboxes</I> for storing these types of files. The filename that 
you use will become the toolbox name that is displayed on the bottom toolbar, so 
choose something that is appropriate and preferably short. Save with an .XML 
extension for a toolbox for simulations, or with .soils extension for a soils 
toolbox (nb. for soils toolbox change "Save as type:" drop down list to "All 
Files (*.*)" )</P>

<P>In the "APSIM Toolbox Management" window you will now see your new toolbox added to 
the list of toolboxes. Just click <I>OK</I></P>
<P><IMG src="Create your own or Add someones toolbox_files/image4.jpg" 
border=0></P>
<P>Your toolbox will then be displayed on the bottom toolbar. You can then drag 
components or entire simulations to it or soils you have created. Toolboxes are 
saved automatically when they are closed or when the user interface is shut 
down.</P>

<h3>Add someone else's toolbox</h3>
 
 <p>Any toolboxes that you create can be shared with others by simply giving them a
 copy of the .xml or .soils file for the relavent toolbox. Once you have obtained a copy
 of the other persons .xml or .soils file it is a very simple process to add it to APSIM.</p>
 <p>It is the exact same procedure as above for "Creating your own toolbox" except that in the
 In the "APSIM Toolbox Management" window you choose the <i>Add an existing toolbox to ApsimUI</i> link instead
 of <i>Create a new empty toolbox</i> and you browse to the location on your hard drive where you have
 saved the .xml or .soils file that you wish to add.</p>
