<H1>Creating an APSIM met file using EXCEL</H1>
<p>APSIM met files consist of a section name, which is always <b>[weather.met.weather]</b>, several constants
   consisting of <i>name = value</i>, followed by a headings line, a units line and then the data. Spacing
   in the file is not relevant. Comments can be inserted using the <b>!</b> character.</p>
<p>At a minimum three constants must be included in the file: latitude, tav and amp. The last two of these
   refer to the annual average ambient temperature and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature.</p>
<p>The met file must also have a year and day column (or date formatted as yyyy/mm/dd), solar radiation (MJ/m2), 
   maximum temperature (oC), minimum temperature (oC) and rainfall. The column headings to use for these are
   year and day (or date), radn, maxt, mint, rain.</p>
<p>Other constants or columns can be added to the file. These then become available to APSIM as variables
that can be reportted or used in manager script.</p>
<p><b>Example met file:</b></p>
<P>[weather.met.weather]<br>
latitude = -33.78  (DECIMAL DEGREES)<br>
tav =  16.47 (oC) ! annual average ambient temperature<br>
amp =  13.71 (oC) ! annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature<br>
<br>
<table>
   <tr><td>year</td><td>day</td><td>radn</td><td>maxt</td><td>mint</td><td>rain</td></tr>
   <tr><td>()</td><td>()</td><td>(MJ/m^2)&nbsp;</td><td>(oC)</td><td>(oC)</td><td>(mm)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1991</td><td>1</td><td>28.0</td><td>38.9</td><td>13.4</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1991</td><td>2</td><td>24.5</td><td>37.3</td><td>17.3</td><td>15.1</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
   
<p>To create one of these files in Microsoft EXCEL, open EXCEL and enter data into columns like this:</p>
<img src="Create an APSIM met file using EXCEL\Figure1.gif">
<p>It is important that the column widths are a bit wider than the data in them. Notice in the figure 
the maxt column is wider than it needs to be.</p>
<p>The next step is to save the file as a <i>Formatted Text (Space delimited)(*.prn)</i> file, giving it
a .met file extension. It is recommended that you keep your toolboxes, met files etc in a 
folder <I>not</I> under the APSIM installation directory. Perhaps you could 
create a folder called <I>c:/apsim_toolboxes</I> for storing these types of 
files.</P>
<p><b>Easy way to calculate the tav and amp constants</b></p>

<p>The software team provides a tool called TAV_AMP that will calculate these 2 constants and insert them
into a met file. To download the tool goto: http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Downloads/tav_amp.exe</p>
<p>Full instructions for using the tool can be found here: http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Products/tav_amp.pdf</p>
