<h1>Overview of User Interface</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Starting with version 4, APSIM comes with a user interface that lets users 
configure simulations using a drag and drop paradigm. This interface, unlike 
APSFront, provides complete access to all APSIM parameters and supports 
multiple point simulations.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>When first started (by double clicking the ApsimUI icon from the Apsim icon 
on your desktop), the interface shows toolbar at the top and a toolbar at the bottom and two empty panes in between.

<p><br>
To create a simulation, click <i>New</i> and select a simulation that is 
closest to the type of simulation you want to build.</p>
<p><img src="1%20Overview%20of%20User%20Interface_files/overview2.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>This 
list of default simulations will be expanded over time. In fact, you can add 
your own default simulations to this list allowing you to reuse common 
simulations. </p>
<h3>Description of a simulation</h3>

<p><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Simulation 
Configuration Tree</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Properties for selected component (clock)</u></font></p>

<p>The tree control on the left shows the components&nbsp;that make up the APSIM simulation 
(Simulation Tree). Clicking on a component&nbsp;will show the properties for 
that component on the right. The picture above shows the clock component 
selected with it's properties on the right.</p>

<p>It is recommended that users work their way from top to bottom in the 
simulation tree, checking each component's properties. Components can be renamed 
by selecting them, pausing for a second and then clicking again. Components&nbsp; 
may be deleted from the simulation tree by selecting the component and pressing 
delete. They can also be renamed or deleted by right mouse clicking on them and selecting "Rename" or "Delete". 
Remember though that deleting or renaming components usually has 
implications for other components. For example, deleting a crop usually means 
the management of that crop (e.g. sow, harvest etc), under the Manager 
component, needs to be changed as well.</p>

<p>Note that you can change the order of components in the tree. You do this by right mouse clicking on the component and
clicking <i>Move Up</i> or <i>Move Down</I> or you can hold down the Ctrl key and use the up and down arrow. The order of
the components is not usually important it is merely cosmetic. The only exception is the order under the <i>Manager</i> component.</p>
<h3><a name="Adding components to a simulation via Toolboxes">Adding components to a simulation via Toolboxes</a></h3>

<p>To add components to a simulation tree, click the <i>Standard</i> button on the toolbar at the bottom of the window. 
This will show the standard toolbox containing many components and simulation 
entities that can be dragged onto the simulation tree.</p>
<p><img src="1%20Overview%20of%20User%20Interface_files/overview4.jpg"  border="0" ></p>
<p>A toolbox is a collection of reusable simulation components. By default there 
are many in the standard toolbox that cover a lot of the standard functionality 
required. The onus, though, is very much on the user to know which combinations 
of components work together. It is not expected that first time users will know 
which components work together. The recommendation is to start with a pre-built 
simulation and modify it, rather than starting from scratch. If in doubt, contact
<a href="mailto:apsim-help@csiro.au">APSIM Help</a>.</p>



<p>The <i>New Simulations</i> toolbox contains the standard pre-built 
simulations. These simulations can be dragged to your <i>Simulation Set</i> node 
(the <i>untitled </i>top node in the Simulation Tree).</p>
