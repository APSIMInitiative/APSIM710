      <!-- ###Rice values taken from Sinclair and Horie (1.4 for vegetative), Hasegawa and Horie (RUE declines by 0.5 from PI to maturity).
      ### Note that this is a stepwise relationship. ie 0.8 through to maturity (stage 10)
      ### Chech the reason for this decline - unusual according to Mike.
      ### Lilley figures were 3.1 to flowering and 0.4 thereafter based on PAR. Half of these figures is reasonably in agreement with published figures.
      according to Jamieson et al (1998) (Sirus model) maximum rue for PAR ranges from 2.2-2.5 g/Mj, which corresponds to a rue for
      total radiation of 1.1-1.25, so the i_wheat value is a bit higher than these values
      In NWHEAT the RUE for tops is determined by:  ce_tops = min(2.0, 3.8*divide(g_radn**0.63, g_radn, 0.0))
      So RUE can be even higher than 1.34 (I_WHEAT) and is related to solar radiation, it ranges from 3.8-1.1 for global solar
      radiation range of 1.0-30.0 mj/m2
      RUE increases as the proportion of diffuse radiation within the canopy increases. This proportion will increase at lower
      sun angles and therefore, on average, will be larger at high vs. low latitude, or on overcast vs. clear days
      Meinke's experiment indicated that Neither nitrogen nor water levels affected RUE, it was constant 1.34 for all water and n treatments

      <!-- ###As for final setting above. Above is just up until flowering and not beyond
      K value can increase after ear emergence as a result of light interception of ears.
      Some experiments indicated incease of
      k after anthesis (like nwheat), but this might be due to the rapid leaf senescence and subsequent interception by senesed
      material. It appears appropriate to ignore this apparent increase in k after anthesis and thus ignore the unproductive light
      interception by senesced material (Meinke, 1997)

      <!-- ###Needs To be explored further for rice. Set as for sugar
      In nwheat daytime temperature is used as the following equation to calculate stress_photo
      This gives a minimum, opt and max temperature of -2, 18 and 38C (daytime)
      f=1-0.0025*(Tday-18)*(Tday-18), and if mint<-4, f=0, no photosynthesis occurs.

      ###Lilley observed no further root growth shortly after floral initiation. Others have noted root growth up to flowering
      ###Lilley has water uptake in chapter 3 down to 1-1.1m. Adjusted root depth rate to get this
      The extraction front velocity (mm d-1) typically ranges from 14 to 21 mm d-1 for winter crops. this depends largely on
      whether a lag phase (i.e. no root extension until x days after sowing) is considered or if root extension starts on the
      day of germination.  i_wheat assumes root extention to start at germination and the value for ef_rate is hence at the
      lower end of expected values. the value used here is from the same experiment (APS15) as the kl values. on sandy soils
      I would expect this value to be slightly higher, while corresponding kl values would be slightly lower (MEINKE).
