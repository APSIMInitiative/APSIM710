      Last revised by SCC April 30 1998
      JOB for ENLI - work out why you can't have tt_flag_to_flower = 0
      seems to be a problem in leaf area or biomass routines, not phenology
      SCC 20/10/99 Used separate tpla parameters for each cultivar - recomputed for ttbase = 4
      Not that to connect the leaf area and phenology routines, we really have to use tt_emerg_budvis
      as the tpla_inflection point (or something ca. halfway to flowering).
      General principles for modelling phenology and leaf area of sunflower
      1. Leaf appearance rate differs with cultivar. It is not practical to try to adjust this
      for all new cultivars. Hence, while we try to model bud visible date and use leaf initiation
      rate to estimate final leaf number, we don't try to use leaf appearance rate to drive
      the time from emergence to flowering. It's a bit of a nightmare.....
      2. Leaf area continues to increase beyond 1st anthesis (in fact seems to continue for
      a week to 10d. i.e. until 50% anthesis or even 90% anthesis. End of leaf growth should really
      be at anthesis (or even at start grain-fill....)
      The effect is that the inflection point for leaf area is between 0.63 and 0.66 of the thermal time
      between emergence and the end of leaf area expansion (flowering). This is what we use now.
