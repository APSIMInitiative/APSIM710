<h1>DDRules – Daily time step dairy farm manager module</h1>
<h2>Please Note</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This manager module is currently under heavy development as may be give unacceptable results. <b>Use with caution</b>.</li>
	<li>This module <b>should</b> be capable of grazing crops other that AgPasture, but this is currently untested</li>
	<li>AgPasture reports stolons as an above ground pasture component. DDRules does not graze stolons under any circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	DDRules is a dairy farm manager component originally developed from a collection of rules and management practices developed by Dawn Dally of DairyNZ. A number of 
	the original user input parameters are now being supplied by Apsim modules, most notably pasture mass and quality.
</p>
	Dawn&apos;s rule have since been expanded to allow the reasonable duplication of the farm management 
	involved in the opperation of the Lincoln University dairy farm. The two key aspect of this are 
	feed managment in the form of a feed wedge and related pasture conservation rules.

<h2>How to use DDRules</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>Setting Farm Effective Area [ha]</h3>
<p>
	e.g. FarmArea = 300
</p>
<p>
	The farm effective area is defined as the sum of the area of all paddocks in the simulation. Paddocks are able to be set as being unavailable for grazing (WIP)
	to allow development of forage crops etc. This will affect the grazable area at any given time, but the effective area of the farm will remain unchanged during a
	simulation run.
</p>
<p>
	Note: Currently all paddocks are assumed to be of equal size<br/>
	Todo: Allow individual paddock sizes to be set
</p>

<h3>Grazing Controls</h3>
<h4>Grazing Residual</h4>
<p>
	e.g. GrazingResiudal = 1750
</p>
<p>
	Paddock will be grazed down to the given cover and then fed silage or supplements.<br/>
	Note: AgPasture includes stolons in the above ground pasture mass. These are not considered grazable and as such it may look like DDRules is not grazing 
	to the correct residual. Also all paddocks will be grazed to the same residual irrespective of the plant species in the paddock.
</p>
<h4>Rotation Length</h4>
<p>
	e.g. GrazingInterval = 30
</p>
<p>
	This sets the number of days it takes to graze every paddock on the farm. Internally this is used to calculate the number of days the hard will
	spend in each paddock e.g. 30 days / 10 paddocks (assuming equal size) == 3 grazing days per paddock. <br/>
	Note: Paddocks with the highest masses will be grazed first and as such the current model makes no guarantee a paddock will be grazed. 
</p>

<h3>Supplementation</h3>
<p>
	Cows are assumed to be fully feed throughout the year. Where this demand is unable to be meet by grazing pasture, silage made on farm and then supplements will be fed.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pasture</li>
	<li>Silage (made on farm)</li>
	<li>Supplements (bought in)</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Note: there are many possible ordering combinations that could be implemented e.g. feed 1kg of grain per cow per day (before grazing pasture). Most should 
	be easy to implement but could become complex to manage.
</p>

<h3>Pasture Conservation</h3>
<p>
	Any pasture cut for conservation is assumed to go into silage. Any paddock that exceeds a preset mass during the conservation window is removed from the grazing
	rotation ("shut up") for cutting (once a week).
</p>
<p>
	Example:<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConservationStart = 01-Jan<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConservationFinish = 02-Mar<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConservationTrigger = 3500 kgDM/ha<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConservationResidual = 1200 kgDM/ha<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SilageCutWastage = 5 %<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SilageStoreEnable = 1<br/>
	<br/>
	The above can be interpreted as;<br/>
	The conservation window is from <b>1st January</b> to <b>2 March</b>. Shut any paddock over <b>3500</b> kgDM/ha. At cutting leave <b>1200</b> kgDM/ha standing, <b>5%</b> of the 
	cut mass remains in the paddock as surface organic matter, and the silage collected is to be <b>stored on farm</b> for later use.
</p>
<p>
	Todo:
	<ul>
		<li>Allow the cutting frequency to be set from the manager</li>
		<li>Set maximum (and minimum?) number of paddocks / area able to be shut at any one time</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Irrigation &amp; Fertiliser Application</h3>
<p>In order to simplify whole farm irrigation and fertiliser applications (e.g. centre pivot  irrigation and whole farm top dressing) DDRules implements two
events able to apply water and fertiliser to the whole farm using the same event call system a user would use at a paddock level.</p>
<h4>Old Manager</h4>
<p>
When using the old manager the "Apply" events names have been extend to differentiate between the different event calls;
<ul>
<li>ApplyIrrigation</li>
<li>ApplyFertiliser</li>
</ul>
These events take the same data/options as any paddock level applications. The key difference being a manager script sits at "Simulation Level" and the DDRules
responds to the event with applications to all paddocks in the simulation.
</p>
<h4>New Manager / DLL Code Interface</h4>
<p>For code simplicity overloaded "Apply" event calls are provided for both irrigation and fertiliser
</p>
<h4>Decision Values</h4>
<p>Farm level (i.e. aggregate) decision variable are provide by DDRules to allow the triggering irrigation and fertiliser events. Where possible these
have names equivalent to the paddock level output variables. These return average values for the whole farm.
</p>
<h4>Example Irrigation Rule</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if PlantAvalibleWater &lt; 0.75 then <br/>       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DDRules ApplyIrrigation amount = 5.5<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endif<br/>
<br/>
This will apply 5.5mm of irrigation to the whole farm when the average plant available water level drops below 75%.
</p>
<h4>Example Fertiliser Rule</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (today = date('20-Jan')) then<br/>       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DDRules ApplyFertiliser amount = 100 (kg/ha), depth = 0 (mm), type = urea_N()<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endif<br/>
<br/>
This will apply 100kg of urea nitrogen to the soil surface on the 20th of January.
</p>
<h4>Addition Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>irrigation_efficiency [0-1]</dt>
<dd>This parameter determines the proportion of the irrigation that reaches the soil surface where 1 = all applied water reaches the soil. Default = 1 (i.e. all irrigation reaches soil surface)</dd>
<dt>ApplyFertToEffluentPdks [0,1]</dt>
<dd>Switch to limit the application of fertiliser to effluent paddocks. Default = 0 (i.e. fertiliser not applied to effluent paddocks)</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Parameter Settings</h2>
<p>
	Debug setting are stored in the DDRules.xml file
</p>
<h3>Debug Messages</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><b>DebugLevel</b> [0-4]</dt>
	<dd>Sets the level of detail output to the summary file</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	DDRules debugging messages are controlled via a "debug level" system. 
	The higher the number, the more detail is returned to the console/summary file. 
	Higher level setting include outputs from lower setting e.g. DebugLevel = 2 turn on both
	Apsim level and farm level messages
</p>
<p>
	0 = Disable ALL debug message outs<br/>
	1 = "Apsim" message/event confirmations<br/>
	2 = Farm management level messages<br/>
	3 = Brief Paddock/plant level messages<br/>
	4 = Verbose Paddock/plant level messages<br/>
</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The debug level can be set at the start or during a simulation run. This will override the value in the parameter file. 
This allows the user to either set simulation specific values or enable say verbose debugging output between two dates using and apsim manager script.
</p>
<h3>Cow Energy Demands</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Cow_Interpolation</b> [0,1]</dt>
	<dd>Use interpolation of monthly cow demand and production values: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled</dd> 
</dl>
<p>
	Cow demands are currently based on a fixed monthly herd average (as sourced for DairyNZ). Some of these monthly averages
	can be interpolated back to daily values by the model to "smooth" out some of the default monthly data points.<br/>
	When enabled these interpolations are applied to;
	<ul>
		<li>Live weight change</li>
		<li>Condition score</li>
		<li>Milk production</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Note: The current "simplified" cow model will be depreciated once a biophysical cow model has been created.
</p>

<h3>Break Feeding</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Break Feeding</b> [0,1]</dt>
		<dd>Enable break feeding: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled</dd> 
	<dt><b>GrowthRateWindowSize</b> [&gt;=1]</dt>
		<dd>Window size of moving average pasture growth rate</dd>
</dl>

<p>
	When <b>enabled</b> DDRules attempts to to limit cows intake in relation to the length of time a paddock is to be grazed for to simulation the use of break fencing. A
	moving average of the previous days pasture growth rates is maintained for use in predicting pasture growth.
<p>
<p>
	The calculation used to calculate the amount of dry matter / energy allocated to the herd is;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ME<sub>allowed</sub> = (ME<sub>avalible</sub> + GR<sub>est</sub>) x Days<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ME<sub>allowed</sub> = Amount of energy allocated for removal on the current grazing day [MJME]<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ME<sub>avalible</sub> = (Pasture cover [kgDM] - Grazing Residual [kgDM]) x PastureME [MJME/kgDM]<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GR<sub>est</sub> = Average pasture growth rate over the preceding <b>GrowthRateWindowSize</b> days x Days<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days = Number of days the herd will remain in the paddock
</p>
<p>
	e.g.
	<ul>
		<li>Pasture cover is 2300 kgDM/ha @ 10 MJME/kgDM</li>
		<li>Average pasture growth rate over the last 30 days is 100 kgDM/ha/day</li>
		<li>Current grazing residual is 1500 kgDM/ha</li>
		<li>Herd energy demands is 6000 MJME/ha/day</li>
		<li>The herd is to spend 2 days in the paddock</li>
	</ul>
	then;
	<ul>
		<li>ME<sub>allowed</sub> = (2300 - 1500 + 100 * 2) / 2</li>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 500 kgDM/ha/day * 10 MJME</li>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 5000 MJME/ha will be removed by today&apos;s grazing event</li>
		<li>and the remaining 1000 MJME will be met by supplement feeding</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Todo: An alternative implementation might be to calculate a set amount of supplement to be fed to the herd for each grazing day when the herd enters the paddock i.e.
	on entering the paddock it is estimated that pasture will only meet 80% of the herd requirements, so let&apos;s fed 100 kgDM of silage per day.<br/>
	This would better reflect what dairy farmers to in the real world, but would raise some questions about how well this would work in simulations
	with a small number of paddocks and long rotation periods i.e. spend a considerable amount of time in any one paddock.
<p>
	When <b>disabled</b> if there is enough pasture available in the paddock to meet animal requirements then this will be grazed. Silage / supplements are
	provided only once the paddock has been grazing down to the current grazing residual. As a result the herd may eat all the available dry matter in 2 days
	and remain in the paddock being fed silage for say 10 days.
</p>
<p>
	Note: the calculate quantity of pasture is removed/grazing from the paddock and any remaining feed demand is met with silage or supplements
</p> 
<h2>Module Inputs/Outputs</h2>
