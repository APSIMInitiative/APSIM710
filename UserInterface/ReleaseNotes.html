<p><strong>Release Notes for APSoil</strong></p>

<p><u>Version 5.6 </u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed the <em>water</em> tab, Manage Crop right click menu to allow a new crop parameterisation to be added.</li>
  <li>Apsoil now doesn't fully expand the soils tree at start up. It now only shows the states in the tree</li>
  <li>The comment box is now read/write.</li>
  <li>The predicted crop parameterisation for Black and Grey vertosols now appear correctly.</li>
</ul>


<p><u>Version 5.5 </u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added GPS Latitude, Longitude (WGS84), Accuracy and APSoil Number under the <em>General</em> tab.</li>
  <li>Added Mn(mg/kg) and Al(meq/100g) under the <em>Soil Profile</em> tab.   </li>
  <li>Added an option to get the latest soils file from the web. See button titled <em>Get latest data</em></li>
  <li>Added a new button <em>Release Notes</em> that displays these release notes. </li>
  <li>Fixed defect where the <em>Change PH units</em> button wasn't converting the PH column.</li>
  <li>Fixed defect where the <em>Export to spreadsheet</em> option was mangling the summer and winter <em>Cona</em> and <em>U</em> dates during the transfer to Excel.</li>
  <li>Changed the way predicted LL numbers are calculated for Black and Grey Vertosols. It now uses the top 3 layers of LL15 values for the top 3 layers of predicted crop LL values. The other predicted crop LL layers remain as they were in the previous version of APSoil. </li>
  <li>Fixed defect where if you open a .soils file without the  password (as any non administrator would), and then open a new file you would be unable to import data as the import features are greyed out.</li>
</ul>
